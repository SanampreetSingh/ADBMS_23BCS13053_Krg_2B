### âœ… [Experiment 1](./experiment1.sql)
**Aim:**  
Design and implement normalized relational database schemas using SQL for author-book and department-course relationships.

#### ðŸ”¹ Part A â€“ Easy Level:
- Create `AUTHOR1` and `BOOKS1` tables with proper foreign key relationships.
- Insert data related to authors and their books.
- Use `INNER JOIN` to retrieve book names along with author names and their countries.

#### ðŸ”¹ Part B â€“ Medium Level:
- Create `DEPARTMENT` and `COURSE` tables with foreign key constraints.
- Insert department and course data.
- Use a **correlated subquery** to count courses per department.
- Filter and display departments offering **more than two** courses.
